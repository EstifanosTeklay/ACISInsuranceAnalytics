Usage Instructions
Data Version Control (DVC)
This project uses Data Version Control (DVC) to track and manage datasets.

Data Version Control (DVC) is an open-source tool that helps you manage and version control your datasets. It works alongside Git to provide a complete solution for reproducible and collaborative machine learning projects.

To use the datasets in this project with DVC, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/EstifanosTeklay/ACISInsuranceAnalytics.git
cd AiML_ACIS-insurance-solutions
Install the project dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize DVC in your project directory:

dvc init
Set up a DVC remote storage. For example, to use a remote storage location, run:

dvc remote add -d remote_name storage_location
Pull the data from the remote storage:

dvc pull
This will download the dataset files associated with the project.

You can now access the datasets and use them in your project.
